        1st approach: BFS + hashset to avoid loop
        - similar to leetcode 127) word ladder

        Time    O(MÃ—N)  
            M=length of gene, in this case is 8
            N=number of genes in the bank
            Finding out all the transformations takes M iterations for each of the N genes. 
            Also, breadth first search in the worst case might go to each of the N gene.
